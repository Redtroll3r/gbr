        <p>
            The Great Barrier Reef is located in Queensland, Australia along the coast. [3]
            The full length of the Great Barrier Reef is 1,600 miles which is about the same distance from Boston to Miami. [8]
            This living organism can be seen from outer space and the physical size of the Great Barrier Reef is larger than the countries, Switzerland, Holland, and the United Kingdom combined. [3]

        <h2>What is the Great Barrier Reef?</h2>
        <center><img class="img-container" src="great-barrier-reef-facts.jpg"></center>
        <p>
            The Great Barrier Reef is the worldâ€™s largest reef system and one of the seven natural wonders of the world. [6] 
            It is believed that the Great Barrier Reef is 500,000 years old. [8]
            The Great Barrier Reef is a popular tourist destination with over two million visitors each year. [6]
            It also promotes economic growth for Australia bringing in about AU $2 billion due to tourism. [9]
            There have been recorded 30 species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises, 6 species of sea turtles, 215 species of birds, 17 species of sea snake, and more than 1,500 species of fish.[6]
        </p>
        <p>
            The Great Barrier Reef is divided into 30 <a href="http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/bioregions/BioregionsExplained.htm">bioregions</a> and each bioregions consist of different types of reefs. [8]
            The Great Barrier Reef includes cresentic reefs located surrounding Lizard Island and north of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and in the Swain Reefs. [8]
            Flat reefs also known as planar reefs are found near Cape York Peninsula, Princess Charlotte Bay and Cairns. [8]
            Ribbon reefs are found  on the northern part of the Great Barrier Reef. [8]
            Fringing reefs are infrequent, but are found in the southern part of the Great Barrier Reef and attached to high islands such as the Whitsunday Islands. [8]
            Lagoonal reefs are found south of the Great Barrier Reef and north off the coast of Princess Charlotte Bay. [8]

        <p>
            The Great Barrier Reef is built on on the base of a giant mountain system known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dividing_Range">Great Dividing Range</a>. [12]
            The Great Dividing Range is the third longest mountain range in the world. [12]
            13,000 years ago when the sea level was about 200 feet lower than the current level, the coral began to grow at the base of the Great Dividing Range were continental islands at the time. [8]
            When glaciers melted due to global warming, many of the islands became submerged and allowed for the coral to expand and grow. [8]
           
        </p>
        <center><img class="img-container" src="great_dividing_range.png"></center>
        <p>[10]</p>
        <p>
             The Great Barrier Reef formed from a drifting coral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyp">polyp</a>. [12]
             Coral polyps are considered  animals and part of the jellyfish family. [8] 
            The coral polyp attaches itself to a stationary object such as a rock or shell. [10]
            After the polyp settles, it uses the algae living within it to provide energy through sunlight for the polyp to make limestone to build the reef structures. [8]
            After the polyp has developed, it can reproduce through fragmentation, asexual, and sexual reproduction. [13]
            Asexual reproduction allows for coral colonies to grow, while fragmentation and sexual reproduction typically allows for coral to form new colonies by drifting with the currents. [13]
            As more coral settles around it, they compete for resources and new coral is added on top of dead coral which expands and changes the shape of the reef. [12]

        <p> 
            The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people settled in the area 40,000 years ago. [9]
            These people fished and hunted in the waters of the reef. [9]
        </p>
        <p>
            The earliest documentation of the reef is from the French. [9]
            A voyage sailed along the Great Barrier Reef led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook">Captain James Cook</a> in 1770. [9]
            Their ship, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Endeavour">the Endeavour</a>, struck the reef on June 11 and crew spent six weeks repairing their ship. [9]
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1981, the Great Barrier Reef was declared a World Heritage Site which means it gets special protection because of its international importance. [9]
            The Great Barrier Reef was also put on the National Heritage List of 2007. [9]

        <h1>Threats to Coral Reefs</h1>
        <center><img class="img-container" src="coral-bleaching.jpg"></center>
        <p style="padding-bottom:30px; text-indent:40px;">
            The Great Barrier Reef faces threats that can damage it permanently. [1]
            Even though coral reefs are naturally resilient, there are multiple threats causing harm to coral reefs globally. [1]
            These threats include climate change, poor water quality, coastal development, and fishing. [1]
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom:30px; text-indent:40px;">Severe weather events such as cyclones can weaken the reefâ€™s structure. [1]
            With the rise of global warming, the increase in sea temperature causes heat stress on coral reefs and leads to mass <a href="https://www.oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coral_bleach.html">coral bleaching</a>. [1]
            Coral bleaching is when conditions such as temperature, light, or nutrients cause symbiotic algae to expel from itâ€™s tissues turning the coral white. [1]
            When this happens, corals are less resilient and more prone to become damaged. 
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom:30px; text-indent:40px;">Poor water quality due to sedimentation and nutrient run-off bring in outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish who eat the tissue off the coral.  [1]
            Water quality also negatively impacts tourism, fishing, recreation, research, and education. [1]
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom:30px; text-indent:40px;">A large portion of land near The Great Barrier Reef is used for agriculture, mining, urban and industrial development, as well as port development and residential development. [1]
            All these forms of development can impact the coral reef by clearing out portions of the ecosystem needed to survive. [1]
        </p>
        <p style="padding-bottom:30px; text-indent:40px;">Illegal fishing practices can also harm the reef and can danger the natural environment by disturbing the ecological balance of the reef. [1]
            However, commercial, recreational, Indigenous and charter fishing is supported if regulations are followed to ensure coral reef remains healthy. [1]
